Read `build-mode.md`, `tower-spec.md`, and `path-spec.md` before proposing any
code for analytics. These metrics depend on authoritative maze geometry, tower
stats, and the navigation gradient contracts already enforced elsewhere.

This roadmap mirrors the other `*-impl.md` guides: each stage is mergeable on
its own, respects the message-passing architecture, and keeps analytics
computation fully decoupled from the gameplay hot path. Nothing has landed yet,
so every checkpoint below is marked `[TODO]`.

# 1) [DONE] Analytics contracts (`core`)

**Goal:** Introduce an explicit stats surface so systems can publish analytics
without leaking internal helpers.

**Deliverables:**

* [x] Define a `StatsReport` DTO that exposes the five metrics (tower coverage mean,
  firing-complete percentage, shortest path length, tower count, total DPS) plus
  doc comments describing sampling rules and invariants.
* [x] Add a `Event::AnalyticsUpdated { report: StatsReport }` (or similar) emitted
  whenever analytics recompute, and a `Query::analytics()` helper returning the
  latest report for adapters.
* [x] Introduce a `Command::RequestAnalyticsRefresh` so build-mode tools can nudge
  recomputation without reaching into the analytics system directly.
* [x] Document determinism expectations: analytics recomputation must derive solely
  from authoritative world state, never wall-clock timers.

**Exit checks:** `core` compiles, analytics types have documentation, and unit
tests/doctests illustrate that the report is immutable consumer-facing data.

# 2) [DONE] World data taps (`world`)

**Goal:** Expose the authoritative data analytics need without cross-cutting the
simulation authority layers.

**Deliverables:**

* [x] Add a `world::analytics` module that snapshots tower placements, spawner
  indices, target tiles, and cached tower DPS values without mutating gameplay
  state.
* [x] Extend `world::query` with read-only accessors that provide:
  * [x] the static navigation field/path gradient already stored for movement; and
  * [x] a lightweight iterator over tower entities yielding cell coordinates,
    targeting range, and DPS.
* [x] Emit `Event::MazeLayoutChanged` (if not already available) whenever build-mode
  adds/removes towers or modifies walls, keeping that emission inside world
  mutation handlers so gameplay systems stay untouched.
* [x] Backfill world tests ensuring layout edits set the dirty flag and that
  analytics queries match the authoritative state (tower counts, DPS sums).

**Exit checks:** World crate compiles, analytics queries are read-only, and
layout mutations reliably publish the layout-changed event.

# 3) [DONE] Analytics runtime (`systems/analytics`)

**Goal:** Build a dedicated pure system that listens for layout changes and
recomputes metrics on demand, keeping CPU usage predictable.

**Deliverables:**

* [x] Add a new `systems::analytics` module with an `Analytics` struct storing the
  last `StatsReport`, a queue of pending recompute requests, and reusable scratch
  buffers for path traversal.
* [x] Implement `ConsumesEvents` to watch for `MazeLayoutChanged` and
  `Command::RequestAnalyticsRefresh`, coalescing multiple signals into a single
  recompute per tick.
* [x] Ensure `Ticks` (or equivalent update trait) runs at normal game cadence but
  performs recomputation only when dirty, so analytics update in the background
  while remaining deterministic and CPU-friendly.
* [x] Write system-level tests verifying that tower edits enqueue a recompute and
  that the report is published via `Event::AnalyticsUpdated` without touching
  other systems.

**Exit checks:** System crate compiles, analytics system introduces no new
imports into gameplay modules, and unit tests confirm lazy recomputation.

# 4) [TODO] Metric algorithms (`systems/analytics::metrics`)

**Goal:** Implement the concrete metric calculations with deterministic integer
math and bounded iteration.

**Deliverables:**

* [x] Reuse the navigation field/pathfinding gradient to extract the shortest path
  from every spawner to the goal, selecting the overall shortest as the analysis
  track. Cache this path as a vector of cell indices for reuse during coverage
  sampling.
* [ ] Implement the invulnerable bug sweep:
  * [ ] For each cell on the path, gather towers whose range covers the cell and
    accumulate the per-cell coverage ratio (`towers_in_range / total_towers`);
    return the mean percentage as a fixed-point integer or rational documented
    in the spec.
  * [ ] Measure the earliest firing opportunities for towers:
    * [ ] Traverse the cached path in order, and for each tower record the first
      path cell where the bug is within range.
    * [ ] Report the path-length percentage corresponding to the furthest "first
      opportunity" among all towers. If any tower never gains line-of-sight,
      clamp the metric to 100%.
* [ ] Compute supporting metrics directly from the tower iterator: total count and
  sum of DPS (damage per second), ensuring the DPS calculation mirrors the
  authoritative combat system (document the formula source).
* [ ] Add focused unit tests on synthetic mazes covering corner cases: no towers,
  towers with zero DPS, spawners equidistant from the goal, and layouts where
  some towers never fire.

**Exit checks:** Metrics module compiles, tests cover edge cases, and all loops
execute in O(path_length Ã— tower_count) time with documented bounds.

# 5) [TODO] Adapter integration & docs (`adapters` + guides)

**Goal:** Surface analytics to build-mode UI without coupling adapters to system
internals, and document usage for future maintainers.

**Deliverables:**

* [ ] Update build-mode adapters to issue `Command::RequestAnalyticsRefresh` whenever
  the player confirms a tower placement/removal, and subscribe to
  `Event::AnalyticsUpdated` to display the latest report.
* [ ] Document the analytics flow in `build-mode.md` (or a dedicated `stats-spec.md`)
  covering recompute triggers, expected latency, and background execution
  guarantees.
* [ ] Extend replay/tests to ensure analytics events appear deterministically given
  a fixed build sequence.
* [ ] Run the full guard suite (`cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --deny warnings`,
  `cargo test`, `cargo hack check --each-feature`, `cargo +nightly udeps`) to
  establish a clean baseline once analytics land.

**Exit checks:** UI receives analytics updates without new tight coupling,
replay fixtures remain deterministic, and documentation explains the background
compute guarantees.

Following this sequence keeps analytics authoritative, rebuilds metrics only when
layout changes, and isolates stats logic inside a dedicated system so gameplay
code stays untouched.
