# Maze Defence sprite manifest
#
# This file maps `SpriteKey` variants to on-disk asset paths relative to the
# repository root.  Rendering adapters load sprites deterministically at startup
# using this manifest, so the mapping must remain stable.
#
# Future extensions can add metadata fields (e.g. texture format, animation
# frames) alongside the existing paths.  Keep comments descriptive so reviewers
# can validate that the manifest still aligns with the source art committed in
# Git.
