# Bug sprite placeholders

This folder stores sprites referenced by `SpriteKey::BugBody`.

Expected files:

* `bug.png` â€” Default bug body rendered as a single-cell sprite centred on its
  pivot.  Future enemy variants should either replace this file or add new
  manifests entries with descriptive filenames.

When importing art, document the source, licence, and any required build steps
below.
