//! Core contracts shared across the Maze Defence engine.
//!
//! This crate defines the message surface that connects adapters, the
//! authoritative world, and pure systems. Adapters submit [`Command`] values
//! describing desired mutations, the world executes those commands via its
//! `apply` entry point, and then broadcasts [`Event`] values for systems to
//! react to deterministically. Systems consume event streams, query immutable
//! snapshots, and respond exclusively with new command batches.
